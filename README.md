## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Development Framework
**Decision:** [Chosen framework ‚Äì e.g., React Native]  
**Date:** [Insert Date]  
**Status:** Approved  

### Context & Problem Statement
The app must be developed for **Android** and should provide a responsive and interactive user experience. We need to decide on a development framework that:  
- Supports **Android deployment**  
- Aligns with our **team‚Äôs skill set**  
- Provides **good performance and ease of development**  

### Options Considered  
| Framework     | Pros                                        | Cons                            |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| React Native | Fast development, strong community, reusable components | Slightly larger app size |
| Ionic        | Cross-platform, web-based                  | Less native performance        |
| Cordova      | Simple, works with web technologies        | Slower performance, lacks native feel |
| Framework7   | Great for hybrid apps                      | Less support & documentation   |
| NativeScript | Direct access to native APIs               | Steeper learning curve         |

### Decision Outcome  
**We chose:** **React Native** ‚úÖ  

#### Reasoning:  
- Strong **community support** & active maintenance  
- Efficient for **Android app development**  
- Works well with **Bootstrap for styling**  
- Offers **better performance** than other hybrid solutions

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Navigation Strategy
**Decision:** [Chosen strategy ‚Äì e.g., Bottom Tab Navigation]  
**Date:** [Insert Date]  
**Status:** Approved  

### Context & Problem Statement
Users need an intuitive way to navigate the **Weather Forecast App**. The navigation should:  
- Be **user-friendly** and require minimal taps  
- Fit within an **Android mobile experience**  
- Allow easy switching between **locations & weather views**  

### Options Considered  
| Navigation Type         | Pros                                   | Cons                         |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Bottom Tab Navigation | Simple, familiar to Android users     | Limited space for many screens |
| Side Drawer Navigation | Good for many sections               | Less intuitive for quick switching |
| Stack Navigation      | Easy to implement                     | Less efficient for multi-screen apps |

### Decision Outcome  
**We chose:** **Bottom Tab Navigation** ‚úÖ  

#### Reasoning:  
- **Best for mobile apps** with **limited screens**  
- Users can easily **switch between locations & settings**  
- **Standard design pattern** in Android apps

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Hardware Features  
**Decision:** No additional hardware features ‚úÖ  
**Date:** [Insert Date]  
**Status:** Approved  

### Context & Problem Statement  
The Weather Forecast App does not require additional hardware features. Users can manually enter locations, and weather data will be retrieved via an API. Features like GPS, speaker, or fingerprint scanner are **not necessary** for the core functionality.  

### Options Considered  
| Feature       | Pros                         | Cons                         |
|--------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------|
| GPS          | Auto-detects user location   | Requires permissions, not necessary |
| Speaker      | Could provide voice alerts  | Not essential for app function |
| Fingerprint Scanner | Could be used for personalization | Not relevant for a weather app |

### Decision Outcome  
**We chose:** **No hardware features** ‚úÖ  

#### Reasoning:  
- The app **does not require location auto-detection**; users can manually enter their location  
- **No need for sound-based alerts**  
- **No user authentication required**, so fingerprint scanning is unnecessary

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Data Storage
**Decision:** [Chosen storage ‚Äì e.g., Remote Database]  
**Date:** [Insert Date]  
**Status:** Approved  

### Context & Problem Statement
The app must store **weather data and user preferences** efficiently. The decision should consider:  
- **Speed & performance**  
- **Data persistence** (should weather data be stored or fetched in real-time?)  
- **Security concerns**  

### Options Considered  
| Storage Type            | Pros                          | Cons                        |
|-------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Local Storage (Encrypted)  | Faster access, works offline  | Takes up device space      |
| Local Storage (Unencrypted) | Simpler implementation      | Security risk              |
| Remote Storage          | Always up-to-date data       | Requires internet connection |

### Decision Outcome  
**We chose:** **Remote Storage (Weather API + Firebase for settings)** ‚úÖ  

#### Reasoning:  
- **Weather data should always be current**, so using an **API** makes sense  
- **User preferences** (saved locations, units) will be stored using **Firebase**
