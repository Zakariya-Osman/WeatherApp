## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Development Framework
**Decision:** React Native ‚úÖ  
**Date:** [Insert Date]  
**Status:** Approved  

### Context & Problem Statement
The app must be developed for **Android** and should provide a responsive and interactive user experience. We need to decide on a development framework that:  
- Supports **Android deployment**  
- Aligns with our **team‚Äôs skill set**  
- Provides **good performance and ease of development**  

### Options Considered  
| Framework     | Pros                                        | Cons                            |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| React Native | Fast development, strong community, reusable components | Slightly larger app size |
| Ionic        | Cross-platform, web-based                  | Less native performance        |
| Cordova      | Simple, works with web technologies        | Slower performance, lacks native feel |
| Framework7   | Great for hybrid apps                      | Less support & documentation   |
| NativeScript | Direct access to native APIs               | Steeper learning curve         |

### Decision Outcome  
**We chose:** **React Native** ‚úÖ  

#### Reasoning:  
- Strong **community support** & active maintenance  
- Efficient for **Android app development**  
- Works well with **Bootstrap for styling**  
- Offers **better performance** than other hybrid solutions

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Navigation Strategy  
**Decision:** Modeled after the **Google Pixel Weather App** ‚úÖ  
**Date:** [Insert Date]  
**Status:** Approved  

### Context & Problem Statement  
Users need an intuitive way to navigate the **Weather Forecast App**. We want to **model our navigation** after the **Google Pixel Weather App**, which offers:  
- A **clean and minimalistic UI**  
- **Swipe gestures & smooth transitions**  
- **Easy access to hourly & daily forecasts**  
- **Quick location switching**  

### Options Considered

|------------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Bottom Tab Navigation | Simple, familiar to Android users     | Limited space for many screens |
| Side Drawer Navigation | Good for many sections               | Less intuitive for quick switching |
| Stack Navigation      | Easy to implement                     | Less efficient for multi-screen apps |

### Decision Outcome  
**We chose:** **A swipe-based navigation system inspired by the Google Pixel Weather App** ‚úÖ  

#### Reasoning:  
- **More intuitive than bottom tab navigation** for a weather app  
- Allows users to **swipe between hourly, daily, and location-based forecasts**  
- **Minimalist and clean UI**, optimized for Android

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Hardware Features  
**Decision:** **Use Phone‚Äôs GPS for Location Detection** ‚úÖ  
**Date:** [Insert Date]  
**Status:** Approved  

### Context & Problem Statement  
The **Weather Forecast App** will utilize **GPS hardware** to improve user experience by automatically fetching weather updates based on the user‚Äôs real-time location.  

### Options Considered  
| Feature       | Pros                                  | Cons                         |
|--------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| GPS          | Auto-detects user location for real-time weather updates | Requires user permission |
| Manual Location Entry | No need for permissions | Less convenient for users |
| Speaker      | Could provide voice alerts          | Not necessary for MVP        |
| Fingerprint Scanner | Could be used for personalization | Not relevant for a weather app |

### Decision Outcome  
**We chose:** **Phone‚Äôs GPS for real-time location updates** ‚úÖ  

#### Reasoning:  
- **Enhances user convenience** by fetching real-time weather data for their exact location  
- **Removes the need for manual location entry**  
- **Standard feature in most weather apps**, making the experience seamless

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Data Storage
**Decision:** Remote Storage (Weather API + Firebase for user settings) ‚úÖ  
**Date:** [Insert Date]  
**Status:** Approved  

### Context & Problem Statement
The app must store **weather data and user preferences** efficiently. The decision should consider:  
- **Speed & performance**  
- **Data persistence** (should weather data be stored or fetched in real-time?)  
- **Security concerns**  

### Options Considered  
| Storage Type            | Pros                          | Cons                        |
|-------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Local Storage (Encrypted)  | Faster access, works offline  | Takes up device space      |
| Local Storage (Unencrypted) | Simpler implementation      | Security risk              |
| Remote Storage          | Always up-to-date data       | Requires internet connection |

### Decision Outcome  
**We chose:** **Remote Storage (Weather API + Firebase for settings)** ‚úÖ  

#### Reasoning:  
- **Weather data should always be current**, so using an **API** makes sense  
- **User preferences** (saved locations, units) will be stored using **Firebase**
