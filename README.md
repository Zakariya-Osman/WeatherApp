## Weather Forecast App Overview
The Weather Forecast App will display current weather conditions, temperature, and forecasts for a selected location. Users can switch between locations to view weather updates from different places.

## 1. Development Framework
**Decision:** React Native

### Context
The app is being built for Android and needs to be responsive and easy to develop. We want a framework that:
- Works well for Android apps
- Matches our team’s skills
- Balances performance and development speed

### Options Considered
| Framework     | Pros                                  | Cons                           |
|--------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| React Native | Fast development, large community, reusable components | Slightly larger app size |
| Ionic        | Cross-platform, web-based           | Weaker native performance     |
| Cordova      | Simple, works with web tech         | Slower, lacks native feel     |
| Framework7   | Good for hybrid apps                | Less community support        |
| NativeScript | Direct access to native APIs        | Harder to learn               |

### Final Decision
React Native was chosen because:
- It has strong community support and active maintenance
- It is efficient for Android development
- It offers better performance than other hybrid solutions

## 2. Navigation Strategy
**Decision:** Swipe-based navigation (inspired by Google Pixel Weather App)

### Context
The app should be simple and intuitive to navigate. The Google Pixel Weather App provides a clean experience with:
- Minimal UI
- Swipe gestures for different forecast views
- Quick access to multiple locations

### Options Considered
| Navigation Type         | Pros                              | Cons                           |
|------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Swipe Navigation       | Fast, smooth transitions       | May need gesture fine-tuning |
| Bottom Tabs           | Familiar to Android users      | Limited space for screens    |
| Side Drawer          | Works for apps with many pages | Less intuitive for weather   |
| Stack Navigation     | Easy to set up                 | Not ideal for quick switching |

### Final Decision
Swipe-based navigation is the best fit because:
- It allows quick access to different forecasts and locations
- It keeps the UI clean and uncluttered
- It is more efficient than bottom tabs for this use case

## 3. Hardware Features
**Decision:** Use phone’s GPS for location detection

### Context
Users should get weather updates based on their real-time location. GPS allows us to fetch location-specific forecasts automatically.

### Options Considered
| Feature       | Pros                                   | Cons                     |
|--------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| GPS          | Auto-fetches local weather         | Requires user permission |
| Manual Entry | No permission needed               | Less convenient         |
| Speaker      | Could provide voice alerts         | Not a priority feature  |
| Fingerprint  | Possible for personalization       | Not relevant here       |

### Final Decision
GPS was chosen because:
- It removes the need for users to manually enter locations
- It provides real-time weather updates
- It is a standard feature in most weather apps

## 4. Data Storage
**Decision:** Weather API for live data + Firebase for user settings

### Context
We need to store weather data and user preferences efficiently. Weather data should always be up to date, while user preferences (saved locations, units) should be stored securely.

### Options Considered
| Storage Type            | Pros                          | Cons                        |
|-------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Local (Encrypted)       | Works offline, secure        | Uses device storage         |
| Local (Unencrypted)     | Simple, fast                 | Security risk               |
| Remote (API + Firebase) | Always up-to-date data       | Needs internet connection  |

### Final Decision
- Weather data will be fetched via an API to ensure it is always current
- User settings (saved locations, units) will be stored in Firebase

---

## Summary of Key Decisions
- **React Native** for development
- **Swipe-based navigation** for a smooth experience
- **GPS for real-time location updates**
- **Weather API + Firebase** for data storage

This setup balances performance, usability, and maintainability while keeping the app lightweight and intuitive.
