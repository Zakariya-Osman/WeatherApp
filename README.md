## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Development Framework
**Decision:** [Chosen framework ‚Äì e.g., React Native]  
**Date:** [Insert Date]  
**Status:** Approved  

### Context & Problem Statement
The app must be developed for **Android** and should provide a responsive and interactive user experience. We need to decide on a development framework that:  
- Supports **Android deployment**  
- Aligns with our **team‚Äôs skill set**  
- Provides **good performance and ease of development**  

### Options Considered  
| Framework     | Pros                                        | Cons                            |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| React Native | Fast development, strong community, reusable components | Slightly larger app size |
| Ionic        | Cross-platform, web-based                  | Less native performance        |
| Cordova      | Simple, works with web technologies        | Slower performance, lacks native feel |
| Framework7   | Great for hybrid apps                      | Less support & documentation   |
| NativeScript | Direct access to native APIs               | Steeper learning curve         |

### Decision Outcome  
**We chose:** **React Native** ‚úÖ  

#### Reasoning:  
- Strong **community support** & active maintenance  
- Efficient for **Android app development**  
- Works well with **Bootstrap for styling**  
- Offers **better performance** than other hybrid solutions

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Navigation Strategy
**Decision:** [Chosen strategy ‚Äì e.g., Bottom Tab Navigation]  
**Date:** [Insert Date]  
**Status:** Approved  

### Context & Problem Statement
Users need an intuitive way to navigate the **Weather Forecast App**. The navigation should:  
- Be **user-friendly** and require minimal taps  
- Fit within an **Android mobile experience**  
- Allow easy switching between **locations & weather views**  

### Options Considered

| Bottom Tab Navigation | Simple, familiar to Android users     | Limited space for many screens |
| Side Drawer Navigation | Good for many sections               | Less intuitive for quick switching |
| Stack Navigation      | Easy to implement                     | Less efficient for multi-screen apps |

### Decision Outcome  
**We chose:** **Bottom Tab Navigation** ‚úÖ  

#### Reasoning:

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Hardware Features
**Decision:** [Chosen features ‚Äì e.g., GPS]  
**Date:** [Insert Date]  
**Status:** Approved  

### Context & Problem Statement
To improve usability, we need to determine which hardware features will enhance the **Weather Forecast App** experience. Possible features:  
- **GPS:** Auto-detects the user‚Äôs location for real-time weather updates  
- **Speaker:** Could be used for voice alerts (not required)  
- **Fingerprint Scanner:** Not relevant to a weather app  

### Options Considered  
| Feature       | Pros                                 | Cons                           |
|--------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| GPS          | Provides accurate location-based weather | Requires location permissions |
| Speaker      | Can provide weather alerts         | Not necessary for MVP        |
| Fingerprint Scanner | Could be used for personalization | Not relevant for weather updates |

### Decision Outcome  
**We chose:** **GPS** ‚úÖ  

#### Reasoning:  
- **Essential for auto-detecting location-based weather updates**  
- Provides a **better user experience** by removing manual location entry

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Data Storage
**Decision:** [Chosen storage ‚Äì e.g., Remote Database]  
**Date:** [Insert Date]  
**Status:** Approved  

### Context & Problem Statement
The app must store **weather data and user preferences** efficiently. The decision should consider:  
- **Speed & performance**  
- **Data persistence** (should weather data be stored or fetched in real-time?)  
- **Security concerns**  

### Options Considered  
| Storage Type            | Pros                          | Cons                        |
|-------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Local Storage (Encrypted)  | Faster access, works offline  | Takes up device space      |
| Local Storage (Unencrypted) | Simpler implementation      | Security risk              |
| Remote Storage          | Always up-to-date data       | Requires internet connection |

### Decision Outcome  
**We chose:** **Remote Storage (Weather API + Firebase for settings)** ‚úÖ  

#### Reasoning:  
- **Weather data should always be current**, so using an **API** makes sense  
- **User preferences** (saved locations, units) will be stored using **Firebase**
